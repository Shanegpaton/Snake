# Snake Game (MIXR)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the MIXR (Mixed Reality Simulation Platform) framework. The game was built to experiment with basic graphics and real-time user interaction within a simulation environment.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- Control the snake using the arrow keys.
- Eat the food to grow longer.
- Avoid running into yourself or the boundaries.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- `C++`
- `MIXR` for rendering and input handling
- Basic game loop logic and collision detection

## ðŸš§ Limitations

- Built specifically for the MIXR framework, which requires a custom environment to run.
- Not intended to be a polished or extensible game engine â€” just a simple demo.

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- Real-time input handling in a simulation framework
- Drawing and updating game objects using MIXR
- Managing state for game entities (snake, food, score)
